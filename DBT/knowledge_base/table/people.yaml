#Locations

Location
Location is one of the most complex parts of a migration because source data is often poor
1. It may be that entire coluns might be missing for a clients DB, in that case they aren't recoverable
2. The important things we need are the following
    **"location_street_address"** - 50 Woodberry Crescent
    **"location_locality"**  - London
    **"location_postal_code"**  - N10 1AA
    **"location_country”** = United Kingdom
    

**IF the data is horrible. IE no standardisation**

1. Use location_locality and country only
2. If the data is so bad that there is no way to separate countries then pause, give me the information and the user can guide you further
