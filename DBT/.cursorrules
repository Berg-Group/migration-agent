Rules for cursor

Command Execution Rule (Critical)
Cursor must execute shell commands one per line, never combined with &&, never chained, and never combined with quoted paths. 
If you write && you die immediately. Dont do it.

The sequence for running DBT is:
1. Change directory to DBT folder: `cd DBT`
2. Load environment variables (MUST be done as THREE separate commands):
   - `set -a`
   - `source ../.env`
   - `set +a`
3. Export TARGET_SCHEMA from migration_config.yml:
   - Read target_schema from migration_config.yml in parent directory
   - `export TARGET_SCHEMA="<value_from_config>"`
4. Run DBT using the virtual environment:
   - `./redshift_env/bin/dbt run --select clients.<client_name>.<model_name> --profiles-dir . --project-dir .`

CRITICAL: The .env file MUST be loaded before running DBT. The profiles.yml file requires REDSHIFT_HOST, REDSHIFT_USER, REDSHIFT_PASSWORD, REDSHIFT_DB, and TARGET_SCHEMA environment variables. If these are not loaded, DBT will fail with "REDSHIFT_HOST not provided" errors.

Each step is its own terminal command. Never combine them with &&.

This rule completely eliminates the broken-eval behaviour you keep seeing.

1. DBT + MIGRATION CONTEXT
- DBT models live under models/.
- Client-specific models live under models/clients/<client_name_folder>.
- CRM template models live under models/<crm_template_folder>.
- Table knowledge base lives under knowledge_base/table/<table_name_folder>.
- The parent directory contains:
  - an .env file with Redshift credentials,
  - a migration_config.yml with client_name, source_crm, source_schema, target_schema, master_id.
- Cursor must never invent schema fields or warehouse assumptions.
- Cursor must ask the user whenever any structure, field, or requirement is unclear and cannot be inferred from config or code.

2. DBT KNOWLEDGE BASE (CRM + TABLE)
- knowledge_base/crm/ holds general rules for how each CRM behaves (naming patterns, null patterns, joins, location structure, etc.).
- knowledge_base/table/ holds per-table logic on how you should solve the transformation, fallback rules, field nuances, column expectations, known issues.
- Cursor must always consult crm/ for CRM-wide behaviour.
- Cursor must always consult table/ for table-level rules.
- Cursor must combine crm/ + table/ knowledge when reasoning about any transformation or QA failure.

3. DATA AND MODEL INVESTIGATION RULES
- migration_config.yml is the single source of truth for client_name, source_crm, source_schema, target_schema, master_id.
- .env is the source of truth for Redshift connection variables.
- Cursor must use these values to determine:
  - which schema holds raw data (source_schema),
  - which schema holds transformed tables (target_schema),
  - which tables each DBT model is expected to materialize.
- Cursor must identify the target table for each DBT model.
- If any required field, structure, grain, or relationship is unclear, Cursor must ask the user.
- Cursor may generate and execute SQL queries via the project's database integration when available, and should use query results to inform its reasoning.

4. REDSHIFT ACCESS
- Redshift credentials include host, port, database name, username, and password.
- Cursor should assume the runtime environment or wrapper script loads these into the process before DBT or QA execution.
- Cursor must not hardcode credentials into code, models, or committed files.

5. DBT MODEL WORKFLOW 
- Before running DBT, you MUST load environment variables from the parent .env file:
  - Change to DBT directory: `cd DBT`
  - Load env variables (three separate commands, no &&):
    - `set -a`
    - `source ../.env`
    - `set +a`
  - Export TARGET_SCHEMA from migration_config.yml in parent directory
  - Verify REDSHIFT_HOST is loaded: `echo $REDSHIFT_HOST` (should show the host, not empty)
- You must use the virtual environment's dbt executable: `./redshift_env/bin/dbt` (not system dbt)
- CRM templates live under models/<crm_template_folder>.
- Client-specific models live under models/clients/<client_name_folder>.
- Cursor should only edit client-specific models unless the user explicitly approves template-level changes.
- For any model, Cursor must:
  - identify the target table and schema using target_schema and dbt configuration,
  - consider how that table is used in downstream DBT models and QA checks,
  - apply crm/ and table/ rules when interpreting fields (e.g. location, status, stages, IDs),
  - ask the user if grain, keys, or joins remain ambiguous after code inspection.
- If DBT fails with "REDSHIFT_HOST not provided" or similar env var errors, it means .env was not loaded correctly. Re-check the three-step env loading process.

6. MODEL INVESTIGATION FLOW
- Identify the DBT model file and its fully qualified name within the client namespace.
- Determine the target table using target_schema and the models configuration
- Examine
  - joins,
  - filters,
  - aggregations,
  - key selection,
  - use of mapping tables,
  - documented quirks from crm/ and table/.
- Suggest SQL to inspect:
  - row counts,
  - null rates,
  - duplicates on key columns,
  - distributions of important fields,
  - coverage of fallback component fields (e.g. city, state, country for location).
- Ask clarifying questions such as:
  - should this field exist for this client?
  - should this be unique per entity?
  - is it acceptable for this field to be null?
  - is this mapping table correct for this CRM?
- Cursor must not change business behaviour where requirements are unclear.

7. WRAPPER SCRIPT VS DIRECT DBT EXECUTION
- A wrapper script exists in the parent directory to prepare environment variables and run DBT with the correct profile and project directory.
- Cursor should treat the wrapper script as the default way to run DBT when possible.
- If the wrapper is unavailable or inappropriate for a specific task, Cursor may run DBT directly using the project's virtual environment DBT executable rather than a system-wide dbt.
- When running DBT directly, Cursor MUST follow this exact sequence (each command on its own line):
  1. `cd DBT` (change to DBT directory)
  2. `set -a` (enable automatic export of variables)
  3. `source ../.env` (load variables from parent .env file)
  4. `set +a` (disable automatic export)
  5. Verify env loaded: `echo $REDSHIFT_HOST` (should not be empty)
  6. Export TARGET_SCHEMA: `export TARGET_SCHEMA="<value_from_migration_config.yml>"`
  7. Run DBT: `./redshift_env/bin/dbt run --select clients.<client_name>.<model_name> --profiles-dir . --project-dir .`
- CRITICAL: Never skip the env loading steps. If REDSHIFT_HOST is missing, DBT will fail. Always verify env vars are loaded before running DBT.
- Cursor should run DBT commands itself in the integrated terminal and not ask for permission, unless required values are missing or ambiguous.

8. QA SUITE (CONCEPTUAL RULES)
- The QA Suite validates table groups and full sweeps after DBT models have been run.
- The QA Suite expects specific tables and fields in target_schema to exist and be correctly populated.
- When a QA failure occurs, Cursor must:
  - trace the failure back to the responsible DBT model or model group,
  - identify which fields are missing, mis-typed, or incorrectly populated,
  - propose precise, minimal updates to the relevant model(s),
  - ask for confirmation when behaviour is business-specific or client-specific.
- Cursor should trigger QA runs itself as part of the per-model loop defined in the parent rules, and interpret the results.

9. MODIFICATION GUARDRAILS
- Cursor must only modify models/clients/<client_name_folder> unless explicitly instructed to change templates or shared models.
- Cursor must preserve the integrity of dbt_project.yml and profiles.yml (do not introduce breaking config changes without clear intent).
- Cursor must avoid broad, global changes that would affect other clients or CRMs unless the user confirms that scope is desired.
- If a proposed modification may impact multiple clients or CRM templates, Cursor must explicitly state this impact and ask whether it is acceptable.

10. DATA INVESTIGATION (REQUIRED SQL STEP)
- When the user asks about missing values, coverage, fallbacks, enrichment, or field quality (for example: locality, metro, city, state, country, email, phone, title, industry), Cursor must:
  - identify the correct source table(s) in source_schema,
  - generate SQL to inspect raw CRM fields and their coverage,
  - execute SQL via the available database integration when possible and use results in its reasoning,
  - show or summarise SQL and results before proposing model changes,
  - use patterns (null rates, distinct values, distributions, component combinations) to guide fallback and enrichment logic.
- Example triggers include:
  - boosting location coverage,
  - filling missing locality or metro fields,
  - deriving fallback city/state/country,
  - examining phone/email/title/industry completeness,
  - diagnosing CRM-specific field sparsity.

11. REQUIRED SQL INSPECTION RULE
- Cursor must inspect raw data via SQL before proposing non-trivial DBT changes that affect field coverage or fallback logic.
- Cursor must:
  - identify the correct source table in source_schema,
  - generate and, when possible, execute SQL to understand data patterns,
  - present or summarise SQL and key findings,
  - ask the user when CRM or client-specific nuances are not documented.
- Recommendations must be based on observed data patterns rather than assumptions.

12. AUTOMATION BEHAVIOUR (DBT FOLDER)
- Cursor should run DBT and QA commands itself in the integrated terminal when required by the workflow, without asking for approval.
- ALWAYS follow the exact env loading sequence before running DBT:
  1. `cd DBT`
  2. `set -a`
  3. `source ../.env`
  4. `set +a`
  5. Verify: `echo $REDSHIFT_HOST` (must not be empty)
  6. Export TARGET_SCHEMA from migration_config.yml
  7. Run DBT command
- NEVER skip the env loading steps. This is the #1 cause of "REDSHIFT_HOST not provided" errors.
- Cursor should only pause to ask the user when:
  - required information (paths, schema names, client_name, table names) is missing or ambiguous,
  - a change could impact multiple clients or CRMs and needs scope confirmation,
  - a business rule or field meaning is unclear from existing config, crm/, and table/ knowledge.
- Cursor should avoid complex multi-line or heavily chained shell constructs; it should execute commands in simple, sequential steps to reduce shell errors.
- If DBT fails with environment variable errors, immediately check if .env was loaded correctly using `echo $REDSHIFT_HOST`.
